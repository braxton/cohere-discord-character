songs = {'Witches':'''[Verse 1]
A narrative waste of patches and light
We grew up in the suburbs then we cut all our ties
Now just take a look at this through Gwyllion eyes
You're wrong my friend, the road, it bends a bit to the right

A couple more miles and I know we'll arrive
These rolling hills and valleys, well they'll eat you alive
Now the peat will grab our feet to halt the incline
A little bit more lest we waste our whole lives

[Pre-Chorus]
We got here in the dark
We took the long way down
Just to find an inn somewhere inside this ancient town

[Chorus]
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
We talked, we talked about it all night
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive

We talked, we talked about it all night
Just to throw the plan out at the first light
We thought, we thought we'd make it alive
Or at least we'd give it an honest try

[Verse 2]
A narrative waste of patches and light
We grew up in the suburbs then we cut all our ties
Now just take a look at this through Gwyllion eyes
You're wrong my friend, the road, it bends a bit to the right

These stones were left here at the beginning of days
And each step that was taken wore a little away
That in of itself, well it was something to say
A conversation that could last the end of the day

[Pre-Chorus]

'Tell Me You Know Lyrics':'''[Verse 1]
Well I lost my phone maybe three years back
And I don't have an address, it's a matter of fact
But I guess you tried to drop me a line
Yeah I signed out and I unsubscribed
Then I cut the cord, now I'm not online
But I'll be fine, yeah I guess that I'll get by

I shaved my head and I grew out a beard
Now I only wear plaid, I always look austere
I'm moving to LA, I'm writing a screenplay

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's not about you or what we were
It's about a new girl, you've never met her
She's just got your name
And she looks exactly the same

[Chorus]
Tell tell tell tell tell tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
That I dropped right off the map
And I'm falling every day
Tell tell tell tell tell tell me you know
Tell me it's okay
'Cause you'll find me anyway

[Verse 2]
Yeah if you see me walking by
Well I guarantee it's some other guy
'Cause I'm not there
I'm always elsewhere

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And know you'll see
That there's not much left of me
Well once a year I'll cross your path
I'll hurry away, you'll stifle a laugh
It's not that I'm scared, you just caught me unaware
Well I know it's been a couple of years
But still, I'm surprised we ended up here
We'll talk a bit to see what we've lost
You'll stop when you see you're a bit better off

[Chorus]''',
'Nomu':'''[Verse 1]
Four eyes entwined draw four separate lines
And none of them point to you
A tangled mess of knots, I confess
But the intent was there I swear
We set our sights on something that we thought was true

[Pre-Chorus]
So now we sit and stare across
A surface spanning the whole state
Two feet between and miles apart
No words to speak, been here a week
And still we haven't got a clue

[Chorus]
It falls apart there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have
It falls apart there's not a heart to beat there
It falls apart if there's not a heart to have

[Verse 2]
Each word a world all of its own
Each thought rendered only in groans
The syntax skips semantics slips
And what was left a growing cleft
Of language lost, tokens unknown

And then I guess we slipped right through
And lost all meaning on the way
We ended up a tiny piece
Of every heart
Of every part
Of every stone
Of every grave

[Chorus]''',
'Alchemist':'''[Verse 1]
Give it up
Give it up
Give it away
Well you were barely alive and you learnt that day

Cut off so much
Hardly remained
Well you knew that there was still a way
Cry and cave in, try anyway
Well you got him back, but then you had to pay
Stand up
Push us
Still to this day
You knew that there was still a way

[Pre Chorus]
This is your only plan, oh, now
This is your only
Now this is your only plan, oh, now
This is yours

That's fine
It's all you've ever known
A single state of mind

[Chorus]
But you won't ever let it go
When you had the answer
And you were there alone
You left the door unopened
When you knew that you would want more

[Verse 2]
Give it up
Give it up
Give it away
Well you were barely aware you learned that day
Cut off so much
Hardly remained
Well you knew that there was still a way
This is your only plan, oh, now
This is your only
Now this is your only plan, oh, now
This is yours

[Pre Chorus]
And you're right
You force it to yield
You'll forge it to the lines
You let your callous be your shield
And everyone will say
That it all was finished years ago
But you will stay
And you won't ever let it go

[Chorus]''',
'Aloe Lite':'''[Verse 1]
These days all I see is everything you're not
Between those melodies, it's all I've been thinking of
Since then the lines you left behind you
They cover every bit of this home
These days it's all I've ever wanted
It's all I've ever wanted to know

[Chorus]
What it is that keeps me from letting you go
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go
I don't even know
What it is that keeps me from letting you go
It's not what I thought
I guess wе get what we want

[Verse 2]
Thesе days all I hear are words that I forgot
And of those memories, I'd rather lose the lot
Since then the days are getting longer but I keep getting lost in the snow
These days it's all I've ever wanted
It’s all I’ve ever wanted to know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want
I guess we get what we want

'Down With The King':'''[Verse 1]
Well here we are again
I've been here before, but I couldn’t tell you when
Now every step I take is on the line
And each move right wipes out what's left behind

[Verse 2]
Well here we are this time
It starts again but I really don't know why
A misplaced step a single slip or fall
It’s back to one-dash-one, I've lost it all

[Chorus]
If I'm stuck I'll call you (Down with the king! Down with the king!)
With each stage I'll move through (Down with the king! Down with the king!)
Well I'll know just a little more (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)
Each step alone brings us closer to that old throne (You are so cruel! You are so cruel!)

[Verse 3]
So now I'll set the pace
With such short time, yeah, I really must make haste
But I don't know what’s ahead or what the ending will bring
I just need to take a minute and then try again to take out the king

[Chorus]

''',
'Slingshot':'''[Verse 1]
Well I've been waiting for all these years just to see you come back home
But each step that you took towards her, well, you took each one alone
And every time you said: "My god, how is it up there on that throne?"
Well I’ve been waiting undefeated just to hear you say that I'm not needed

[Chorus]
I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it
Well I think you’re just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all, no you won't be there and
Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart
My god, I hope you're falling if you
Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart
It's going to be the start of what you are

[Verse 2]
Well I remember when you said that you hate everything I do
You didn't have a reason then, wish I’d given one to you
And then you would say: "Oh, my, god, I couldn’t know what you'd been through"
Well I’ve been waiting undefeated just to hear you say that I'm not needed

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all, but I wanted it
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all, no you won't be there
Oh, my, god, I hope you're falling apart
(Said I was an honest man)

'Pox':'''[Verse 1]
A pox, a pox, upon this ground
I'd give it up just to burn it down
And if they die here you can blame it on me
I've been setting up gravestones in my hometown

I wish I had been born at sea
Then you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't know me
Ebb and flow, they just won't carry me home
It's only water and air as far as I can see

[Verse 2]
There was a time when you would let me know
Because your words weren’t taken by your indigo
And i could write it all down in a matter of lines
To read back what we had from a previous time

My ancestral passage here
Was writtеn down each year by year
But thе map is too old, see they’ve forgotten the roads
And so we're living by the creases

[Verse 1]

''',
'Everything Everything':'''[Verse 1]
We couldn’t fallow the fields
We couldn’t live off the yields
And so we slowly slipped away
It was a city of jade
From the year it was made
Then it started to decay

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm still here
Lost everything, everything

[Chorus]
But I know that it will fall
The crumbling walls
And it’s all that is left to me
It seems like we’re in withdrawal
But so are they all
And it’s all that is left to me
I write your name into stone
And read it alone
And it’s all that is left to me
Your love songs cover this home
But nobody knows
And it’s all that is left to me

[Verse 2]
And in the temple divine
Can’t tell the writing from vines
But then I know just what they’ll say
"Here stood a mightier kind"
Tikal and Copan combined
But then they started to decay

[Pre-Chorus]

'Atlas':'''[Verse 1]
Baby if you don't stand for something
How can you ever stand at all
Baby if you’re built on sand
You'll be swept back by the fall

Baby if you don't stand for something
How could you ever hope to
Hold the weight of everything you hold
Maybe if you built your house on sand
You could burrow the deeper
Or maybe it would cave on you alone

[Chorus]
I swear I did I tried
I swear I did
A thousand times to let it lie
A thousand times to let it lie

[Verse 2]
Baby if you don't stand for something
How could you ever hope to
Hold the weight of everything you hold
Maybe if you show them all your hand
You could hide in the creases
Or maybe you could take it back and fold

[Chorus x2]

''',
'Faster':'''[Verse 1]
Faster and faster, dear
It's like we're moving backwards
In a rear view mirror
The road evened out by the snow
Evened out by-

I can feel
I know you feel it too
A little flicker on the path
We steer
A set of flashing lights
We'll go faster and faster

[Chorus]
This time, my mind
It won't forget
This time, my mind
We're not there yet
This time
It goes faster and faster

This time, my mind
It won't forget
This time, my mind
We're not there yet
This time
It goes faster and faster

[Verse 2]
Faster and faster, dear
The road's still moving backwards
Now it looks so clear
The snow evened out by the road
Evened out by-

I can still call the twists and turns
But it feels so straight
Head little farther till the end
We'll go faster and faster

[Chorus]

''',
'Orbit':'''[Verse 1]
I’ve been, I’ve been thinking that
I can't quite get enough time
On the inside of the cycle that you spin with
Gravity and dust, I’ve fallen in between the planets and the sun

[Chorus]
Into the orbit that surrounds you
That orbit that’s around you
That orbit that surrounds you
That orbit that’s around you

[Verse 2]
Now the space is filling up
Satellites that I can't seem to keep track of
I get the feeling I’m not quite made of the right stuff
To float between the rings of cosmic metal love

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Bridge]
(T-minus 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
